# **ANCIENT TRADES**

A basic Python CLI application that simulates the economic history of a few civilizations.

## **How it works**

The program only runs a couple of tests for now, it will soon be more interactive for a better user experience.

## **How to run it**

Be sure to have the [latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of **Python** installed. Then, simply navigate to a new folder and execute the following commands in the terminal (swap 'pip3, python3' for 'pip, python' if on Windows):

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Fendross/ancient-trades .
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To execute the main game, run (_not yet implemented_):

```zsh
python3 ancient_trades.py
```

To execute the test file, run:

```zsh
python3 test_ancient_trades.py
```
