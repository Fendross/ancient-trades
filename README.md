## How it works

The program only runs a couple of tests for now, it will soon be more interactive for a better user experience.

## How to run it

Be sure to have the [latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of **Python** installed. Then, simply navigate to a new folder and execute the following commands (swap 'pip3, python3' for 'pip, python' if on Windows):

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Fendross/ancient-trades .
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ancient-trades.py
```
